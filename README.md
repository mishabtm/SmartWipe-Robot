# SmartWipe: Vision-Guided Whiteboard Eraser 🤖✨

**SmartWipe** is an open-source, low-cost Cartesian coordinate robot designed to automate whiteboard cleaning in educational institutions. Unlike standard wipers, it uses **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** to detect ink and selectively erase only the written areas, saving power and time.
